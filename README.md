# YouTube Music Hack

## Transforming YouTube Music into a Native-Like Premium App

### Overview

This guide details how to hack YouTube Music to function as a native premium application on iOS devices using userscripts. For Android users, YouTube Vanced is recommended. Although there were attempts to enhance the native experience by adding a progressive web app (PWA) to the headers, userscripts do not function in PWAs. Therefore, the solution involves running YouTube Music in a browser.

### Initial Attempt

The first method attempted involved overriding the `visibilitychange` event. However, this approach proved ineffective after a page reload.

### Second Attempt

The second method focused on modifying the serialized experiment flags within the YouTube Music configuration. This script listens for the `load` event and updates the `serializedExperimentFlags` with new values to enable premium features.

### YouTube Premium Features

Key features of YouTube Premium include:

1. **High Audio Quality** 游댮
   - Non-premium accounts accessing `https://music.youtube.com/youtubei/v1/player` cannot retrieve formats with high audio quality, even if audio quality settings are modified in `ytcfg`.
2. **Download Audio** 游리
   - This can be possible by disabling expiration in IndexedDB. This involves modifying the `yt-it-response-store` entry, particularly the `expireTimestampMs` value.
3. **Audio Mode Switcher** 游릭
   - The `ytcfg` setting `IS_SUBSCRIBER` enables this feature.
4. **Cast to a TV Device** 游리
   - This feature allows users to cast audio and video to compatible TV devices.
5. **Background Play** 游리
   - Overriding the `visibilitychange` event was an initial attempt but did not work reliably.
   - The `mweb_allow_background_playback` flag works in Safari on macOS but fails to function correctly on iPhones when the screen is locked.

### YTcfg Comparison: Premium vs. Base

The comparison of `ytcfg` between the premium and base versions reveals the following:

**YTcfg:**
- `"IS_SUBSCRIBER": false` -> `true` : Enables premium features if you have a premium account.
- `"AUDIO_QUALITY": "AUDIO_QUALITY_MEDIUM"` -> `"AUDIO_QUALITY_HIGH"` : Changes the audio quality setting for premium accounts.

**Serialized Experiment Flags:**
- `"ab_fk_sk_cl": true` : Not found in JS sources.
- `"ab_sa_ef": true` : Settings related to ads.
- `"enable_is_extended_monitoring": true` : Not found in JS sources.
- `"enable_web_home_top_landscape_image_layout_click_location": true` : Not found in JS sources.
- `"music_web_enable_server_queues": true` : Likely allows saving the play queue on the server side for continuous listening across devices.
- `"music_web_is_canary": true` : Not found in JS sources.
- `"music_web_is_canary_control": true` : Not found in JS sources.
- `"music_web_canary_stage": 0` -> `2` : Not found in JS sources.

### Notes

- Premium features cannot play audio in the background on the web, only in the app.
- Detailed settings might be uncovered by reversing the YouTube Music APK.
- A full content dump from both premium and base versions is needed for a thorough comparison.
